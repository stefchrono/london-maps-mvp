# london-maps-mvp

This is an MVP for a London commuting web app. As a python developer, I created this project as an exercise to hone my front-end skills. Along the way I managed to not only understand JavaScript but to get hands-on and park Python for a few days.
Throughout this project, I intentionally focused more on JavaScript and jQuery. 

It is a Django project, consuming Google Maps APIs and Transport for London (TfL) APIs.
